#  Full Stack Developer for TinyMLaaS Platform

## Overview of the Role
[NinjaLABO](https://ninjalabo.ai),
a new AI startup funded by the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) (ESA)
and specializing in **Embedded AI**, is seeking an experienced Full
Stack Developer. This role offers the exciting opportunity to contribute
significantly to our TinyML as-a-Service (TinyMLaaS) platform
([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9427352) & [demo](https://youtu.be/zPPVzjHHE10?si=ZOgAsr0PSt7xAt15)).
Your work will directly impact the accessibility of [TinyML](https://www.tinyml.org/) technologies,
integrating seamlessly with leading AI SaaS like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), [Weights
& Biases](https://wandb.ai/), and utilizing cloud services such as [Docker API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/).


## Your Role and Responsibilities

- **Backend Development**: Initiate the project by focusing on creating a
  robust and scalable backend using FastAPI. This foundational work is
  essential for ensuring the platform's stability, performance, and
  security.
  
- **Frontend Development**: After establishing the backend, shift
  attention to the frontend, employing [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) or [stlite](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite). The aim
  here is to develop an intuitive user interface that mirrors our
  customers' workflows, optimizing for ease of use and enhancing user
  engagement.
  
- **CLI Generation**: Take charge of improving the platform's
  accessibility by automating the creation of command-line interface
  (CLI). This task involves generating the CLI from a [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
  ([OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)) specification file, making it easier for developers to
  interact with our platform.
  
- **Integration with AI SaaS and Cloud Services**: Work on integrating the
  platform with leading AI SaaS and cloud services, including [Hugging
  Face](https://huggingface.co/) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). This involves not only incorporating these
  services into our platform but also ensuring they function cohesively
  to expand our offering and elevate the user experience.



## What We're Looking For

- Deeply experienced in backend development, with expertise in FastAPI.
- Proficient in integrating a variety of cloud services and AI SaaS platforms, such as [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and [W&B](https://wandb.ai/), into our backend infrastructure. 
- Knowledgeable in frontend development, capable of creating simple
  user interfaces using Streamlit or stlite. The frontend development
  will complement the backend services by translating complex
  functionalities into user-friendly workflows.
- Skilled in automating CLI generation from [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification files.

This profile is tailored for a developer who excels in backend and
cloud services integration, viewing these elements as the critical
foundation of the platform, and who can then effectively apply their
skills to frontend development to create a cohesive, user-focused
experience.


## Bonus Skills
- Experience with cloud infrastructure and services [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), [Weights
& Biases](https://wandb.ai/)
- Experience in training DNN models using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) (or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)).


## Your Work Environment
- Fully remote position utilizing [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/) methodology.
- Utilization of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
- Workflow managed through
[GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects),
[GitHub Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows),
