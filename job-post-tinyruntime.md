# Embedded AI developer for DNN runtime

## About the Job
Are you a passionate software engineer with interest in Embedded systems
(IoT) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), seeking a thrilling opportunity
to become a key technical contributor at an innovative AI startup
backed by the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) (ESA)?

Join us at [NinjaLABO](https://ninjalabo.ai),
where we're developing DNN runtimes for IoT devices,
to be integrated into our TinyML as-a-Service (TinyMLaaS) platform
([research](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9427352) &
[demonstration](https://youtu.be/zPPVzjHHE10?si=ZOgAsr0PSt7xAt15)).
Your work will directly impact the accessibility of [TinyML](https://www.tinyml.org/) technologies, which run small AI on microcontrollers in IoT devices.

## What We Need to See
1. Good at C/C++ programming.
2. Familiar with training DNN models using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) (or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)).

## What You'll Be Doing
Have a role in the development of DNN runtimes,
focusing on hands-on code contributions with DevOps.

- Train DNN models with [quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization) techniques.
- Implement DNN **runtime**s for specific DNN models
