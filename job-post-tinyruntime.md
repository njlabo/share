# Embedded AI developer for DNN runtime

## About the Job
Are you a skilled software engineer with expertise in Embedded systems
(IoT) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), seeking a thrilling opportunity
to become a key technical contributor at an innovative AI startup
backed by the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) (ESA)?

Join us at [NinjaLABO](https://ninjalabo.ai), where we're developing tiny DNN runtime,
focusing on crafting minimalistic DNN inference-only engines renowned
for their efficiency and compact footprint, tailored for specific DNN
models and IoT devices. This would be leading to the Machine Learning
Compiler ([ML Compiler](https://petewarden.com/2021/12/24/why-are-ml-compilers-so-hard/))
products eventually under our [TinyML as-a-Service](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9427352)
(TinyMLaaS).


## What You'll Be Doing
Have a leading role in the development of DNN runtimes, focusing on
hands-on code contributions in diverse software engineering
environments.

- Train DNN models with [quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization) techniques.
- Develop efficient, concise **runtimes** for specific DNN models and hardware configurations.


## What We Need to See
- Experience in training DNN models using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) (or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)).
- Strong command of C/C++ programming.
